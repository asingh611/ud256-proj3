Problem 6
In this problem, the goal is to get the min and max value from an input list in O(n) time, with the additional goal of finding the min and max in a single traversal. In order to do this, the first value of the list is stored as the min and the max. Then the list is linearly traversed and for each number along the list, it is compared against the current min and max value, which are updated as needed. The min and max values are then returned. In terms of space complexity, the intermediate min and max values are stored in order to compare against during the traversal.
